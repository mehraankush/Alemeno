    },
    {
        "question": "How does React work?",
        "answer": "React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it performs all the necessary updates before making the changes in the browser DOM. This process makes it very fast and efficient."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are components in React?",
        "answer": "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that can be nested, managed, and handled independently."

        "question": "What is JSX?",
        "answer": "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It looks similar to HTML and is used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React."

    {
        "question": "How do you pass data between components in React?",
        "answer": "Data is passed between components using props. Props are short for properties and they are read-only. Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is state in React?",
        "answer": "State is a built-in object in React that allows components to create and manage their own data. State can change over time and when it does, the component re-renders."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are hooks in React?",
        "answer": "Hooks are special functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Redux?",
        "answer": "Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is commonly used with React to manage complex application state. Redux helps to centralize the state and logic in the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you handle events in React?",
        "answer": "Events in React are handled similarly to handling events on DOM elements. However, there are some syntax differences, such as using camelCase for event names and passing a function as the event handler."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between props and state?",
        "answer": "Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, and they are read-only. State is used to manage data that can change over time within a component. While props are immutable, state can be changed using the setState method."
